The little water tub? That’s telling you how to wash it—cold, warm, or hot. The triangle? That’s your bleach signal—whether it’s a yes or a big no. The square with a circle? That’s your drying guide, and if there’s an iron icon, it’s saying, “Hey, here’s how to press me without messing up!”<\/p>"}},"questions_WPBRHe":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"What does the “tub of water” symbol mean on the care label?","answer":"<p>It’s not just a cute doodle—it’s the boss of washing instructions. It tells you how to wash the garment (machine wash, hand wash, or avoid water entirely) and the maximum temperature to use. Follow it, and your clothes will thank you.<\/p>"}},"questions_RQCLaA":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"Can I iron all Ludic products?","answer":"<p>Not necessarily! Look for the iron symbol. If it’s there, it’ll guide you on the right heat setting. If it’s missing or crossed out, step away from the iron. And for delicate fabrics, always use a protective cloth—because no one wants a shiny, burnt patch on their favorite tee!<\/p>"}},"questions_DTAhFC":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"What’s the difference between Ludic’s Classic\/Regular Fit and Relaxed Fit?","answer":"<p>The Classic\/Regular Fit is your everyday hero—straight cut for a clean, relatable fit that works anywhere. The Relaxed Fit, though, is the chill sibling—loose, slightly oversized, and perfect when you want comfort with style.<\/p>"}},"questions_NXDQTH":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"Do I need to size up for Ludic’s Relaxed Fit?","answer":"<p>No sizing up needed! The Relaxed Fit is designed to drape loosely without hugging your arms or torso, so just go with your usual size and enjoy the easy-breezy vibe.<\/p>"}},"questions_VD3A78":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"Which Ludic fit should I choose for my style?","answer":"<p>For a polished, standard look, stick to the Classic\/Regular Fit. If you’re in the mood for a laid-back, oversized feel, the Relaxed Fit is the one to rock.<\/p>"}},"questions_VH4YiP":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"Can I wash my Ludic canvas sneakers in a washing machine?","answer":"<p>Yes, but only if the label says “safe for washing machine.” Pop them into the Ludic cover (or a pillowcase), set the machine to a normal cycle, and air dry them thoroughly in sunlight. Don’t forget to remove and dry the insoles separately!<\/p>"}},"questions_tLaErG":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"How do I clean Ludic vegan suede or vegan leather sneakers?","answer":"<p>For vegan suede or vegan leather, skip the washing machine! Use a soft toothbrush, lukewarm water, and a mild detergent. Gently scrub the upper, sole, and insole, then dry everything in sunlight for at least a day. Treat them with care, and they’ll look sharp for longer.<\/p>"}},"questions_VTAYa3":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"What’s the best way to dry Ludic footwear after cleaning?","answer":"<p>Always air dry your footwear in sunlight. It helps them dry thoroughly and naturally. Avoid using heaters or dryers—they can mess up the shape or material of your sneakers.<\/p>"}},"questions_nbTRER":{"type":"questions","settings":{"question":"Can I clean the insoles separately?","answer":"<p>Absolutely! Take the insoles out and either hand scrub them or toss them in the washing machine in a pillowcase or Ludic cover. Make sure they’re fully dry before putting them back in.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["questions_EFEVaM","questions_WPBRHe","questions_RQCLaA","questions_DTAhFC","questions_NXDQTH","questions_VD3A78","questions_VH4YiP","questions_tLaErG","questions_VTAYa3","questions_nbTRER"],"settings":{"layout":"box_width","bg_color":"","padding":"0px 0px 0px 0px","margin":"80px 0px | | | 36px 0px","enable_breacrumb":true,"similar_articles":"support-similar-articles"}}},"order":["main","rich_text_button_VYcpTb","support_questions_eCdqKJ"]}
